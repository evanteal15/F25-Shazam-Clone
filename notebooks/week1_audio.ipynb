    "# What is a sound wave?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds are produced via vibrations of air particles which form sound waves. Sounds waves have the same 3 defining characteristics as other waves: frequency (which is the measure of the number of vibrations per second measured in Hz), amplitude (measure of the intensity of the sound which is taken in terms of dB), and phase (the state that the wave cycle that the sound is in at a single point in time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds we hear, as shown in the waveform below, are produced by the combinations of waves of many different frequencies and amplitudes compounded together. Constructive and destructive interference influence how these waves interact with each other, increasing and decreasing the amplitude of each frequency accordingly. Understanding all of this process is not necessary but it is important to know that sound is a combination of many waves with varying loudness and pitch which come together in a way that humans can listen to and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=asset/wave_comp.png width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Speakers make sounds by pushing a cone up and down according to the data in an audio file. This produces vibrations in the air to produce the sound waves that make the same sound as what was recorded from the original sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the main audio file formats of .mp3 and .wav files store an amplitude value amplitude at each time step. The \"amplitude\", usually measured in dB, again informs the position that the cone should be pushed to at any time with high values measuring moving the cones forward and low values meaning pulling the cone back in order to create the desired sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=asset/file.png width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how audio is stored, how are we able to go from a sound to an audio file in the first place? Well this is informed by two measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sample rate** - number of samples per second (Hz). The sampling rate determines the time resolution of our representation.\n",
    "    - The time in seconds between consecutive samples is $1/\\mathrm{sr}$, called the sampling interval\n",
    "- **bit depth** - The number of bits used to store each sample. The larger the bit depth, the more precision we have to store frequency information (frequency resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the sample rate and bit depth, the higher the resolution of audio we are able to play and record. A higher sample rate leads to more frequency measurements taken and a higher bit depth means that we have more possible frequencies (you can think of frequencies as notes for simplification) that the audio can take on when stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this project we will be using wav files instead of mp3 files due to wav files being uncompressed. Compressed audio files (like mp3s) do not retain all sonic information from an original recording in order to save memory overhead making them good for streaming. However, this is not ideal for audio processing and recognition due to the normalization of the volume and reduction of very high and very low frequency sounds.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is because of this theorem that you probably noticed that sampling rates twice that of the frequency are able to sample exactly at each peak and valley. This proves that in order to fully capture information about a wave of a given frequency and thus be able to reconstruct it during audio playback, we need to sample at twice that frequency.\n",
    "\n",

    "If we do not have a high enough sampling rate we can run into the phenomenon of aliasing. When the sampling rate is not fast enough to accurately reconstruct the highest frequency waves in the waveform, which results in misrepresenting them as low frequencies. This is a big issue for shazam's algorithm since we need to be able to know the distribution of the frequencies of the original audio to make an accurate prediction.\n",
